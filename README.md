# Cheat Engine Tables
Here are some Cheat Tables that I've made for some reason or another. There will likely be a
bunch of useless loading stuff from Load Removers so either ignore it or remove it.   

Bioshock Infinite (obvious) - Flight, Collision, and Game Speed  
Final Fantasy Type-0 HD (fftype0hd.CT) - XYZ Coordinates, Movement Speed, Money, and Chocobo Male  
Metal Gear Rising Revengeance (obvious) - XYZ Coordinates, Health, BP, Game Speed and more!  
Resident Evil 5 PC (re5dx9.CT) - XYZ Coordinates
